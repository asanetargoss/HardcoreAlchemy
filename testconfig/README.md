**WARNING**: Some of the configs in `[PROJECT_NAME]/run/config/` will be overridden when running gradle commands. If you want a config change to be permanent, edit its corresponding file in `testconfig/`.

Also, in case you're wondering: No, these are not the config files for the Hardcore Alchemy modpack. They are mostly stock config files, with a few changes to make development easier.
